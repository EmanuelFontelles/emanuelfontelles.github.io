# ArchLinux welcome to freedom
When I started to work with computers and Linux based systems, I found myself in Ubuntu distributions, Ubuntu 10.04 was one of the bests. With time and experience I tried Debian OS, Elementary OS, LinuxMint OS, RedHat, but all theses systems seems to be the same. I don't know but I can't stop to search for the best distro for me. Until the ArchLinux show up!
